# Exam project for SpinPlay
## Launching:
To launch the project with the local server, just run
- npm install
- npm run start

Which launching the parcel bundler:
"start": "parcel src/index.html --open",
That's it. Enjoy!

## Debug information:
When you launch the project, you can see into the console some info messages,
and the table with weighs which mapped to the credits. 

Also, there are a few console commands to make debug easier:

- weights() - Show the weights and assigned credits
- weight = N - Setup the custom weight for the next spin
- spin() - Invokes the spin action from the console
